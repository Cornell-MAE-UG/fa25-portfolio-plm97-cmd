For the final project of MAE 3260 System Dynamics, we were asked to model a new system using techniques from class. 

We chose to model the pitch dynamics of an Airbus A320, specifying our own design requirements based on information known about the aircraft. We then linearized the  equations of motion based on a the assumptions of steady flight with minimal disturbances. We used these equations of motion to derive the open-loop transfer function for the system and then implemented a closed-loop PID controller.
